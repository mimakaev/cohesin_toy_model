## A toy model of cohesin/condensin translocation on a chromatin fiber 

A model that uses brownian dynamics to simulate a "walker" that can translocate along a simulated fiber
being driven from one location (SMC heads).

The walker relies on a polymer spring (NIPBL, or could be other component) that acts as a ratchet.
Spring has affinity both to DNA and to the hinge of the complex, if all 3 are together.
During the power stroke, the spring is attached to both DNA and the hinge.
The complex is extended, stretching the spring, and translocation happens. 
After the power stroke, the spring detaches from the hinge/DNA.
Thus during the reverse of the power stroke, the hinge holds no affinity to DNA,
thus creating asymmetry in the translocation.
