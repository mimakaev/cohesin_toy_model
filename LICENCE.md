## Attribution Requirements

### 1. Software Distribution

Any software project that incorporates, adapts, or derives from the Software,
in whole or in part, must include **clearly visible attribution on the primary

repository README, project homepage, or application "About" page). This
attribution must:

- Identify the specific components adapted from or based on the Software.
- Include the name of the original project and a link to its repository.
- Be visible without requiring the reader to expand hidden sections, navigate
  to subpages, or inspect source code.

Attribution placed solely in source code comments, dependency files, license
directories, or other locations not visible on the primary public-facing page
does **not** satisfy this requirement.

### 2. Academic and Scientific Use

Any scientific publication, poster, presentation, talk, preprint, or report
that presents results obtained using the Software, in whole or in part, must
include attribution **in the main body of the work** (e.g., the Methods section
of a paper, the body of a poster, or the content of presentation slides). This
attribution must:

- State which components of the Software were used.
- Briefly describe the purpose for which they were used.
- Include a reference to the original project (citation, URL, or DOI as
  appropriate to the format).

Attribution placed solely in supplementary materials, acknowledgments sections,
footnotes, or reference lists does **not** by itself satisfy this requirement.
